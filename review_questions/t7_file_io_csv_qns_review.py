# 1.
# Write a program that writes the `numbers` list to a csv file in the current working directory.
# Name the csv file as `numbers.csv`.

# numbers = [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [12, 14, 16, 18, 20], [22, 24, 26, 28, 30]]


# 2.
# Write a program to read `numbers.csv` file created from the last exercise.
# The program will read and print each line from the csv file as follows:

    # ['2', '4', '6', '8', '10']
    # ['12', '14', '16', '18', '20']
    # ['22', '24', '26', '28', '30']


# 3.
# Write a program to write `weather` list to a csv file in the current working directory.
# Include three headers : Day, Temperature, Wind Speed in the csv file.
# Name the csv file as `weather.csv`

# weather = [["Monday", 28.7, 10], ["Tuesday", 30.2, 15],  ["Wednesday", 32, 9], ["Thursday", 26, 19],  ["Friday", 28, 14]]


# 4.
# Write a program to read `weather.csv` file created from the last
# exercise. The program will read the file into a list of dictionaries.
# Name the list as `weather_list`

    # weather_list =
    # [{'day': 'Monday', 'temp': '28.7', 'windspeed': '10'},
    #  {'day': 'Tuesday', 'temp': '30.2', 'windspeed': '15'},
    #  {'day': 'Wednesday', 'temp': '32', 'windspeed': '9'},
    #  {'day': 'Thursday', 'temp': '26', 'windspeed': '19'},
    #  {'day': 'Friday', 'temp': '28', 'windspeed': '14'}]
